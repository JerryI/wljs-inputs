# Standart I/O library for WLJS
*written with love in Javascript*

__This is a core component of [Wolfram JS Frontend](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend) project__
but one can try to use it independently as well

This library allows a user to use standart HTML inputs like slider, radio, file dragging together with Wolfram Language ecosystem. Each input generates an event object, where a handler can be assigned to (please see [Events.wl](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend/blob/master/Kernel/Events.wl)). 

## Development
Only possible with installed [Wolfram JS Frontend](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend)

To build this extension
```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

or for live-update
```shell
npm i
npm run watch
```

## Features
Each type of an input is shipped with two components
- __event generator__ (like `InputButton`, `InputText`)
- __view__ component (like `ButtonView`, `TextView`), which are executed on the frontend

An __event generator__ is just a wrapper of __view component__, that automatically generates an event object and attaches it to the input view. The reason, why they are still separate thing is that __view component__ can act on both sides as an indicator or a display and as an input device. Moreover, it can mutate [FrontEndObjects](https://github.com/JerryI/wolfram-js-frontend) without communicating to Wolfram Kernel.

## Basic usage

### Range input
A basic combo of a slider and numerical input field

```mathematica
range = InputRange[0, 10, 1, "Label"->"Range"]
(Print[#] &) // range;
```

![Range](imgs/range.png)

It sends numberical values to the handler function.

### Text input
Text input, that sends as a string to the kernel

```mathematica
text = InputText["Hi"]
(Print[#] &) // text;
```

### Select

### Wolfram Language Input

### Radio

### Toggle
Acts as a checkbox

```mathematica
toggle = InputToggle[False, "Label"->"Toggle"]
(Print[#] &) // toggle;
```

![Toggle](imgs/toggle.png)

On switch it sends boolean values to the handler.

### Button

```mathematica
button = InputButton["Click me"]
(Print[#] &) // button;
```

![Button](imgs/button.png)

On press it sends `True` to the handler

### File input

Sents any file as a `base64` encoded string via POST method

```mathematica
file = InputFile["Drag and Drop"]
(Print[BaseDecode[#["data"]]//ByteArrayToString] &) // file;
```

![File](imgs/file.png)

Try firstly with some small text files. The structure of the data for each file is following
```mathematica
<|"data"->"base64 encoded byte array", "name"->"filename"|>
```

## Grouping
One can group different inputs into a single event-object, that maintains the original structure

### Associations
```mathematica
group = InputGroup[<|
  "left"->InputRange[0, 10, 1, "Label"->"Range 1"],
  "right"->InputRange[0, 10, 1, "Label"->"Range 2"] 
|>]
(Print[#]&) // group;
```

![File](imgs/groups1.png)

On each update it generates the data fro the handler function in a form

```mathematica
<|"left"->5, "right"->7|>
```

### Arrays
```mathematica
group = InputGroup[{
  InputRange[0, 10, 1, "Label"->"Range 1"],
  InputRange[0, 10, 1, "Label"->"Range 2"],
  InputText["Hi"]
}]
(Print[#]&) // group;
```

![File](imgs/groups2.png)

On each update it generates the data fro the handler function in a form

```mathematica
{5, 7, "Hi"}
```

### Columns and rows

### Manipulate

## Advanced usage (low-level)
In principle one can use __view components__ directly. 

### Range view
This code
```mathematica
range = InputRange[0, 10, 1]
(Print[#] &) // range;
```
at the end transforms into
```mathematica
range = EventObject[<|"id"->CreateUUID[]|>];
RangeView[{0, 10, 1, 5}, "Event"->range[[1]]["id"]] // CreateFrontEndObject
(Print[#]&) // range;
```

However, since this is view component, it can be used in the opposite way like to display a variable

```mathematica
CreateFrontEndObject[7, "variable"]
RangeView[{0, 10, 1, FrontEndExecutable["variable"]}] // FrontEndOnly // CreateFrontEndObject
```

and in the next cell we can change the variable and see the result

```mathematica
FrontEndExecutable["variable"] = RandomInteger[{0, 10}]
```

### Substituting by reference and by variable

The wrapping expression `FrontEndOnly` prevents kernel to substitute the numerical value of `variable` into the view component

```mathematica
FrontEndExecutable["variable"]
```

It connects the variable to the view in a one way. Let us call it substituting __by variable__. 

There is another way to pass `variable` into the component 

```mathematica
FrontEndRef["variable"]
```

For most functions it has the same effect as the previous one, however here connects the variable to the view in two-ways. A view can mutate the variable. Let us call it as __by the reference__. 

Here is an example

![ref](imgs/ref.gif)

In this sence it does not even send anyhting to the kernel, an update cycle happends in the browser. 

### Text view

Here is an example of two fields, where one shows the result and other one is used as an input

![ref](imgs/inouttext.png)

While typing in the first field, one can see an inversed string in the second one.
